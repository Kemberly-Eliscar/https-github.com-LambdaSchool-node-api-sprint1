- [ ] Mention two parts of Express that you learned about this week.
    1. I learned that Express is just pre-written JS code that is a bunch of if/else statements. For example,       "if user asks for 'this', send them back 'that'".

    2. I also learned that Express adds extra functionality to our server like Routing, Middleware support and      a more eloquent API. 

- [ ] Describe Middleware?
    1. Functions that get request and response, can perform operations on them, and can either move into the        next middleware, or return a response back to the client. 

- [ ] Describe a Resource?
